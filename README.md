Python implementation of LACE - Tool used in patient condition analysis .
LACE given as in 
- “L” stands for the length of stay of the index admission.
- “A” stands for the acuity of the admission. Specifically, if the patient is admitted through the Emergency Department vs. an elective admission.
- “C” stands for co-morbidities, incorporating the Charlson Co-Morbidity Index.
- “E” stands for the number of Emergency Department visits within the last 6 months.

* LACE scores range from 1-19 and as mentioned above predict the rate of readmission or death within thirty days of discharge. 
* Below is an example of how to calculate the LACE index. A score of 0 – 4 = Low; 5 – 9 = Moderate; and a score of ≥ 10 = High risk of readmission.

## Note

1. Any improvement to the above code can be performed , but the scoring form must have to be maintained as the same.
2. You are welcome to refine the code and you can implement it using other languages also.
